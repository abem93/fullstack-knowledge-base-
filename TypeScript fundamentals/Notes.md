# Introduction to the Module
  - Typescript is just javascript but with added feature to allow you to define what input to expect in your variables or parameters.

# The rationale behind TypeScript.
  - Typescript is a superset so it extends to javascript adding more feature to javascript such as static typing.

# Installing Typescript
  - The compiler checks and turn the typescript back into vanilla javascript. It communicates any errors in the code.

# Base Types, Primitives, Arrays, Object Types, and Type Inference
  - Primitives are the core value types those include numbers strings and booleans and those come from JS. Arrays and objects considered a more complex type of type of assignment. Type inference referes to when you declare a variable, what ever type you assign it that is the type that is inferred.
