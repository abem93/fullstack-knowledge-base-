# Directives Deep Dive 
  # Module Introduction
  - In this module we will review directives, learn to create our own, learn the difference between attribute and structural directives.
    - structual directives affect the whole DOM, can delete and add elements
    - attribute directives only affect the elements they are added to and their properties but never destroy element.
  # ngFor and ngif Recap
  - recapped ngFor to loop through arrays/list and display them on DOM. Used ngif to toggle between the odds and evens list.
  # ngClass and ngStyle Recap
  - recapped ngClass by creating an 'odd' class in the css that turns the text color to red. in the html component this class is only added to the attribute if number is not evenly divisible by 2. ngStyle we added a background color only if the number was not evenly divisible by 2.
