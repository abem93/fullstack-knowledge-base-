# Directives Deep Dive 
  # Module Introduction
  - In this module we will review directives, learn to create our own, learn the difference between attribute and structural directives.
    - structual directives affect the whole DOM, can delete and add elements
    - attribute directives only affect the elements they are added to and their properties but never destroy element.
