# Handling Forms in Angular Apps 

  # Module Introduction
  - 
    - Forms need to be handled through angular and then through the Angular HTTP service if they need to reach out to a server.
  # Why do we need Angular's Help?
    - we need the values of the information in the form as an object with {key:'value'} pairs and metadata of whether the form is valid.
  # Template-Driven(TD) vs Reactive Approach
    - A template drive approach you setup the template in html and angular infers the structure. The reactive approach you manually define the structure of the form in TS. Also setup the HtML code and manually connect it.
  # An Example Form
    - no action attribute or method, in the HTML code. Form should not be submitted to server.
  # TD: Creating the Form and Registering the Controls
    - we allow angular to view what controls we want registered by adding ngModel into the tag of the input and we also add name="someName" to name our control.
